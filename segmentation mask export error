We are experiencing an issue after exporting segmentation masks from a project. The masks have the wrong resolution and the annotations inside seems cropped.
Our original dataset had 1920x1080 images and the masks are exported as 1080x1920 with the content half cropped.
We enabled and disabled Auto-orient during export, but the issue is still present. Those are EXIF data of the uploaded dataset images:

|cHRM |chunk was found (see Chromaticity, above)|
|gAMA |gamma=0.45454544 (See Gamma, above)|
|IHDR.bit_depth |8|
|IHDR.color_type |2 (Truecolor)|
|IHDR.interlace_method|0 (Not interlaced)|
|IHDR.width,height |1920, 1080|
|sRGB |intent=0 (See Rendering intent)|

To reproduce:
-Create a semantic segmentation project
-Upload some images (ours were 1920x1080)
-Make annotations (we used polygon tools)
-Generate a dataset with no augmentation and only Auto-orient
-Export semantic segmentation masks
-Check the masks, they should have wrong resolution and annotations inside.
